# Agent Guidelines for Marin

## How to Use This Guide

- Start with the shared practices below; if you discover missing guidance, expand this document so the next agent benefits.
- When you uncover directory-specific guidance, add it to the relevant subproject manual so the next agent stays aligned.
- Consult the subproject manuals when working in submodule trees:
  * `lib/levanter/AGENTS.md` for Levanter-specific conventions.
  * `lib/marin/AGENTS.md` for Marin-specific conventions
  * `lib/iris/AGENTS.md` for Iris-specific conventions

## Shared Workflow Playbooks

- Begin with the agent-friendly recipes in `docs/recipes/`.
- For PR descriptions, testing, specifications, and review workflow, follow [pull-request.md](docs/recipes/pull-request.md).
- The first step for dataset addition is schema inspection. See the [add_dataset.md](docs/recipes/add_dataset.md) recipe for details.
- You can help organize experiments using the [organize_experiments.md](docs/recipes/organize_experiments.md) recipe.
- For long-running benchmark/research threads, follow [agent_research.md](docs/recipes/agent_research.md).
- For canary/daily ferry proposal, launch, and monitoring workflow, follow [ferries.md](docs/recipes/ferries.md).
- When making significant changes to Grug/Grugformer, follow [change_grug.md](docs/recipes/change_grug.md).
- For profiling ingestion and agent-driven optimization workflows, follow [agent_profiling.md](docs/recipes/agent_profiling.md).
- Follow the rules and examples in each recipe to ensure compatibility and automation-friendliness.

## Shared Coding Practices

### Tooling

- Assume Python >=3.11.
- Always use `uv run` for Python entry points. If that fails, try `.venv/bin/python` directly.
- Run `./infra/pre-commit.py --all-files` before sending changes; formatting and linting are enforced with `ruff`.
- Keep type hints passing under `uv run pyrefly`; configuration lives in `pyproject.toml`.
- Make minimum code changes; remove fluff when necessary

### Communication & Commits

- NEVER SAY "You're absolutely right!"
- You never credit yourself in commits.
- NEVER EVER EVER credit yourself in commit messages.

### Agent-Generated GitHub Activity

- When an agent creates a PR or an issue using the user's auth token, it must add the `agent-generated` label.
- When an agent comments on a PR or issue using the user's auth token, the comment must begin with an `🤖` emoji unless the exact comment text was explicitly approved by the user. If it cannot be at the very beginning for formatting or workflow reasons, it should come as soon as possible.

### Code Style

- Put all imports at the top of the file. Avoid local imports unless technically necessary (for example, to break circular dependencies or guard optional dependencies).
- Prefer top-level functions when code does not mutate shared state; use classes to encapsulate data when that improves clarity.
- Prefer top-level Python tests and fixtures.
- Separation of responsibilities: when a change introduces a new subsystem (e.g., serving/inference, data access, evaluation), encapsulate lifecycle/configuration in a dedicated module and have callers depend on the interface rather than re-implementing setup/teardown details.
- Disprefer internal mutation of function arguments, especially config dataclasses; prefer returning a modified copy (e.g., via `dataclasses.replace`) so call sites remain predictable and side effects are explicit.
- Use early returns (`if not x: return None`) when they reduce nesting.
- Do not introduce ad-hoc compatibility hacks like `hasattr(m, "old_attr")`; update the code consistently instead.
- Document public APIs with concise Google-style docstrings.
- Prefer small, concrete helpers over abstraction that adds indirection without reuse.
- When defaults depend on environment/resource type, resolve them once and fail fast on unknown/ambiguous inputs rather than silently guessing.
- Keep environment detection logic minimal and explicit; avoid multi-key heuristics unless they are clearly required.
- Prefer single strong signals over sprawling defensive checks when detecting environment state (e.g., check the one variable that must be set rather than many optional ones).
- In marin we generally prefer logging over `print` statements. `print` is fine for debugging and "scripts".

### Error Handling

- Let exceptions propagate by default.
- Only catch exceptions when you can add meaningful context and re-raise, or when you are intentionally altering control flow.
- NEVER EVER SWALLOW EXCEPTIONS unless specifically requested by the user.

### Documentation

- Keep MkDocs content in sync with code. Docs live in `docs/` or in the subproject's `docs/` directory; use Markdown and mkdocs-style links when referencing symbols.
- Public-facing modules and APIs need concise Google-style docstrings; align terminology across code and docs.
- Write docs for readers who do not have conversational context: include enough problem framing, assumptions, commands, and results that the document stands on its own.

### Deprecation

**NO BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY**: Do NOT add deprecation warnings, fallback paths, or compatibility shims. Update all call sites instead. Only add backward compatibility if the user explicitly requests it.

## Comments

You write detailed comments when appropriate to describe code behavior as a
whole, e.g. at the module or class level, or when describing some subtle
behavior.

You don't generate comments that merely restate the code, e.g.

<bad>
     # Use in-memory rollout queue
    rollout_queue = InMemoryRolloutQueue()
</bad>

<good>
# We have found that each instance of a FlightServer can provide approximately 1GB/s
# of throughput. As our typical VMs run with 200Gbps NICs, running 16 parallel servers
# should be sufficient to saturate the network.
</good>

## Planning

- When planning, you produce detailed plans including code snippets.
- You ask questions up front when building a plan instead of guessing.
- When a request feels too large for one pass, capture a plan (for example in `.agents/projects/` when the subproject provides one) before pausing.

## Testing

- Always fix tests if you broke them.
- Do not fix tests by relaxing tolerances or hacking around them.
- Avoid “tautological” tests that merely restate implementation logic as asserts; prefer tests that validate externally-observable behavior, integration points, or realistic failure modes.
- Run the appropriate tests for your changes (for example, `uv run pytest` under the relevant directory); consult subproject guides for preferred markers.
- Use pytest features like fixtures and parameterization to avoid duplication and write clean code.

PREFER:

- Integration style tests which exercise behavior and test the output

DO NOT:

- Create tests which validate obvious features: if a type exists, a constant has a value, etc.


## Environment

- Prefer to use `uv` when possible. If you can't (for instance, due to sandbox restrictions) you can use `.venv/bin/python`
- For local TPU/Ray bootstrap in this workspace, use the GCP project `asura-0`. Do not assume access to `hai-gcp-models` when editing one-off cluster configs or bootstrap steps.
